983582353640402945	Days after publishing that blog post, #cannabis activists started calling me to ask if a) it was true, b) could they pay me for a legal opinion. I said that my blog post and the case referred to was my legal opinion, they should do with it as they wish.

983550599911432193	@globepolitics Okay. This is not about money. These anti smoking lobbyists were to get $11 million this year and $15 million next year.

958890157733588992	@Geddes28 @InklessPW @macleans Highly debatable? Pot is easily and widely available right now, to anyone who wants it, including youth. No one checks for ID. Legal weed will be available to kids in the same way that booze is. And I assure you that right now it's harder for kids to get booze than weed.
